\section{The abstract structure of unitary oracles}

\section{The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm}
The abstract structure of the Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm is presented and its function is verified abstractly, following~\cite{vicary-tqa}. This proof inspires new ways to implement the DJ algorithm, where Fourier transforms are replaced by more general Hadamard transformations, without effecting the algorithm. We investigate these new implementations numerically and analytically. {\bf Status:} undrafted, though the proof and numerical results have been completed.

\section{Grover's algorithm}
For completeness, we summarize the results of \cite{vicary-tqa}, where the single-shot Grover's algorithm is investigated using categorical techniques. {\bf Status:} undrafted.

\section{The hidden subgroup algorithm}
Similarly, we abstractly demonstrate the function of the hidden subgroup algorithm, which leads us to conjecture that a speedup is possible by altering an input query representation. {\bf Status:} undrafted.

\section{\color{blue} The group homomorphism identification algorithm}
We present a new quantum algorithm for the identification of group homomorphisms into abelian groups. {\bf Status:} DRAFTED.

\section{\color{blue} The hidden shift problem}
{\bf Status:} UNDRAFTED.
