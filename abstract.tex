\begin{abstract}
Quantum information brings theories of physics and computer science together in a synthesis that challenges the basic intuitions of both. In this thesis I show that adopting a unified and general language for this synthesis advances both foundations and practical applications of quantum information. In particular, I use the categorical language of abstract process theories to investigate quantum algorithms of practical interest.
