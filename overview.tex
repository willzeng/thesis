By generalizing from quantum information to abstract process theories we are able to lift quantum circuit diagrams into a more powerful notation for specifying and verifying algorithms.  This can then be used to investigate quantum theory, where the high-level structures are now more readily available, and to consider quantum algorithms and protocols in the more general setting of abstract process theories.
