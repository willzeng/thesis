\label{chap:qalg}

\chapabstract{This chapter applies operational generalized compositional theories to the study of quantum algorithms in three ways. The first section connects the Fourier Transform to strongly complementary observables in an oGCT. This provides a new mathematical setting for Fourier theory and pinpoints the reason why the Fourier Transform appears naturally in quantum computation. These results are ongoing collaborative work by the author and Stefano Gogioso that updates our preprint~\cite{gogioso2015fourier}.

The second section applies oGCTs to the verification and generalization of quantum blackbox algorithms. We provide provide a general construction of unitary oracles in arbitrary oGCTs and prove the connection between these oracles and complementary observables. We then extend work by Vicary~\cite{vicary-tqa} to present a quantum blackbox algorithm for a new problem that promises a large separation between quantum and classical query complexities. These results are extensions of collaborative work by the author and Jamie Vicary published in~\cite{zeng2014abstract}.

The third section of this chapter, presents a new toy model for quantum blackbox algorithms in the oGCT of sets and relations along with several mathematical results.  This setting is usually interpreted as a model for nondeterministic classical computation. Results of this section are adapted from work by the author that is currently from the preprint~\cite{zeng2015models}.
