\chapter{Outlook: Complexity \&\ Categories}
\label{chap:outlook}

Here we will propose open problems for connecting the categorical reasoning used for verification of quantum algorithms to analyses of their complexity.  Ideally the complexity classes that are efficiently accessible from different abstract process theories should be directly related to their categorical structure. {\bf Status:} UNDRAFTED.
